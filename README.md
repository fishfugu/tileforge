# TileForge

**TileForge** is a cross-platform board designer project built in C++ with a focus on object-oriented design. It allows users to define and visualise custom boards for tile-based games — from grids to hexes and beyond.

This project is being developed collaboratively using [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) for ease of setup and shared learning.
